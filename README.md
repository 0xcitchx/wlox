WLOXE - Open Source Currency Exchange
=========
WLOXE is an open source alternative currency exchange, created to facilitate the exchange of alternative currencies (*alt-currencies*) for multiple fiat currencies. At this point, the only alt-currency supported is **Bitcoin**. It is not difficult, however, to adapt this project for the use of other alt-currencies.

The purpose of this document is to walk you throught the process of a typical setup using Bitcoin. We will also cover basic (i.e. logo) branding of the exchange.

To set up WLOXE, you will need the following:

Components of WLOXE
--------------
1. Web server running a current version of PHP (a shared hosting or VPS account will work, but we strongly recommend a dedicated server).
2. A MySQL server.
3. A current version of the **bitcoind** client (available at https://en.bitcoin.it).
